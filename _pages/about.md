I'm Di√©go Derksen, I live in the Netherlands and I'm currently employed at the Dutch Railways (NS). 
I specialize myself in Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Defender and Power Automate/Logic Apps. I'm starting this blog because there isn't a lot of (beginner) information about Intune and Defender. I'm trying to fix that.

I'll also be posting some of my hobby projects.
