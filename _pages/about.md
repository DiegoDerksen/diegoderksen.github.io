Hi, I'm Di√©go - a Microsoft technology specialist based in Utrecht. At Dutch Railways (NS), I focus on security and automation, working extensively with Microsoft Intune, Defender, Purview, and Power Automate/Logic Apps.

My goal is to demystify Microsoft technologies. Whether you're new to the field or looking to expand your knowledge, I share practical insights about Microsoft 365, Intune, Defender, and Purview in clear, accessible terms.

Outside of work, I'm dedicated to exploring and testing new technologies. I document these technical explorations here, sharing both successes and learning experiences. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-derksen/)!
