Hello! I’m Diégo Derksen, residing in the Netherlands (Utrecht). By day, I work at the Dutch Railways (NS), where I specialize in Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Defender, and Power Automate/Logic Apps. My passion lies in bridging the gap between beginners and these technologies. Through this blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and practical guidance on Intune and Defender.

In addition to tech talk, I’ll also share some of my hobby projects. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
