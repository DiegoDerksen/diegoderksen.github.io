Hello! I’m Diégo Derksen, residing in the Netherlands, Utrecht. By day, I work at the Dutch Railways (NS), where I specialize in Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Purview and Power Automate/Logic Apps. My passion lies in bridging the gap between beginners and these technologies. Through this blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and practical guidance on Microsoft 365, Intune, Defender and Purview.

In addition to work, I’ll also share some of my IT hobby projects. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
